In the paper, a total of seven CNNs are trained. The first CNN for predicting the square from where a move has to be made. The other six CNNs
are for the prediction for each of the six distinct pieces in a chess (considering white's turn) to go to a particular position as a move.

In our project, we have considered training only two CNNs, which'll perfectly suffice. The first CNN (The_From_Network) for predicting the square from where
a move has to be made. The second CNN (The_To_Network) for predicting the square to where a move has to be made ( given the board layout ).

In Paper: test/validation accuracies of CNNs: {38.3%}, {52.20%, 29.25%, 56.15%, 40.54%, 26.52%, 47.29%}.
